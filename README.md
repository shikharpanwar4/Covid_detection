# Covid_detection using Keras
 - Dataset from - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WwT38_AwU98y4e84xKvqlpTd3FUnivHs/view?usp=sharing (Divided into Train and Val folders by preprocessing the original data)\
 - Original data from - https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset (For Covid +ve X-Rays)\
 - Taken Noramal(Covid -ve) X-Rays from Normal Data of dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia \
 - Training Accuracy - 92%\
 - Validation Accuracy - 98%

By the end of this project, you will be able to build and train the convolutional neural network using Keras with TensorFlow as a backend. You will also be able to perform data visualization. Additionally, you will also be able to use the model to make predictions  on new data.

Feel free to add and contribute to this repository.
